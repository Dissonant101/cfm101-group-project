The goal of the project was to build a robo-stock trader that would maximize the portfolio risk, hence generating a portfolio that has a greater magnitude in its movements.
There were many factors to consider when building this algorithm, but determined that the most effective tools would be to analyze the standard deviation and beta of a stock.
Given that there are always systemic risks in the stock market, the market can be extremely upredictable at times.
This project analyzes the historical price data of stocks for one year and used that data to build the portfolio.
When simulating this portfolio over the course of one week, the algorithm's portfolio returned 5%.
